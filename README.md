# Top-trending-Courses-ML
In this i have a dummy cousre data set of different courses having columns such as rating , completion of the videos , shares and comments on the video .
from this data set i have designed the codes of the model that is trained on this data set and will  able to tell that which corses are trending .
In this rating of the course is the highest parameter than completion of the course followed by share and comments on the course.
Also using matplot library it will abel to show the the bar graphs of those data.
